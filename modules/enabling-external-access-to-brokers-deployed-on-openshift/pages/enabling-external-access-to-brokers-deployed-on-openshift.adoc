#  Enabling External Access to Brokers Deployed on OpenShift

When an acceptor is exposed on an AMQ Broker deployed on OpenShift, the Operator automatically creates a dedicated service and route for each broker pod.

* External clients connect to the broker by using the full hostname of the route.
* External access can be tested using a `curl` command to the route's hostname.
