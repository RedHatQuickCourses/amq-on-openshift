#  Securing AMQ Broker on OpenShift

Securing AMQ Broker on OpenShift involves:

*   **Encrypting Connections**: Configuring SSL/TLS for secure client-broker communication, managing certificates and trust stores on OpenShift, and enabling secure listeners.
*   **Enabling RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Defining users, roles, and permissions within AMQ Broker and integrating with OpenShift's authentication mechanisms.
*   **Integrating External Identity Providers (IDP)**: Configuring AMQ Broker to authenticate against external IDPs like LDAP or Keycloak and mapping external roles to broker roles.
