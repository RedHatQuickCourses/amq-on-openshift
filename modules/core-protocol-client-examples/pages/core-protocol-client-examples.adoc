=== Core Protocol Client Examples

The AMQ Core Protocol is Red Hat's optimized client protocol for AMQ Broker, primarily accessed by Java applications through the Java Message Service (JMS) API.

Key aspects for developing Core Protocol clients:

*   *Introduction to AMQ Core Protocol:* Leverages the JMS API for developing robust, asynchronous messaging applications.
*   *Setting Up a Development Environment:* Involves configuring a Java environment to build client applications that connect to the AMQ Broker.
*   *Core API Entities:*
    ** `ConnectionFactory`: The starting point for establishing connections.
    ** `Connection`: Represents a communication channel between the client and the broker, containing sessions.
    ** `Session`: Provides a context for creating `MessageProducer` and `MessageConsumer` instances.
    ** `MessageProducer`: Used to send messages to a specific destination (queue or topic).
    ** `MessageConsumer`: Used to receive messages from a specific destination.
*   *Configuration:* Often involves using JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) and a `jndi.properties` file to configure `ConnectionFactory` and `Destination` objects.
*   *Messaging Patterns:* Supports implementing both point-to-point (queues) and publish/subscribe (topics) messaging models using producers and consumers.
